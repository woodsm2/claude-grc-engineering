Open-source GRC Engineering resource for Claude.

`claude-grc-engineering` turns technical evidence from cloud, SaaS, code, and security tools into framework-aligned findings, gap reports, remediation guidance, evidence packages, and OSCAL workflows.

It is built for the Claude ecosystem: Claude Code plugin installs first, with Claude Desktop and Claude Cowork usage supported through the same Markdown skills, command runbooks, schemas, and repository files.

It is maintained by the [GRC Engineering Club](https://grcengclub.com) for people who want compliance work to behave more like engineering work: repeatable, testable, versioned, and easy to extend.

## What it does

The toolkit is a Claude Code plugin marketplace. The same plugin skills and command runbooks are also useful in Claude Desktop and Claude Cowork when you add this repository as project context or a shared workspace. Install the pieces you need:

- `grc-engineer`: the core automation hub for gap assessment, IaC scanning, evidence collection, remediation generation, policy generation, PR review, continuous monitoring, and multi-framework optimization.
- Persona plugins: workflows for auditors, internal GRC teams, third-party risk, reporting, learning, and iterative GRC automation.
- Framework plugins: reference guidance for SOC 2, NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, FedRAMP, PCI DSS, CMMC, HITRUST, CIS Controls, GDPR, DORA, HIPAA Security, regional privacy/security regimes, and more.
- Connector plugins: thin wrappers around tools such as AWS CLI, GitHub CLI, gcloud, Azure CLI, Okta, Slack, Datadog, CrowdStrike, Drata, Splunk, Tenable, Snowflake, and POA&M automation.
- Diagram plugins: editable draw.io system boundaries, evidence flows, control maps, risk treatment, audit workflows, framework crosswalks, TPRM, POA&M, data flows, RACI, and operating model visuals.
- OSCAL and bridge plugins: tooling for FedRAMP/OSCAL workflows and integrations with external GRC systems.

The common path is:

```text
connectors collect evidence
        ↓
findings match schemas/finding.schema.json
        ↓
grc-engineer maps findings through SCF
        ↓
reports, remediation, evidence packages, OSCAL outputs
```

The Secure Controls Framework (SCF) crosswalk is used as the control backbone: 1,468 controls mapped to 249 frameworks. The toolkit references control IDs and implementation guidance; it does not reproduce copyrighted standards text.

## Install in 60 seconds

Inside Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add GRCEngClub/claude-grc-engineering
/plugin install grc-engineer@grc-engineering-suite
```

For a first run without cloud credentials, use GitHub as the evidence source:

```bash
/plugin install github-inspector@grc-engineering-suite
/plugin install soc2@grc-engineering-suite
/github-inspector:setup
/github-inspector:collect --scope=@me
/grc-engineer:gap-assessment SOC2 --sources=github-inspector
```

Full walkthrough: [docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md).

Anthropic's security and compliance posture is documented at [trust.anthropic.com](https://trust.anthropic.com/), and the Claude Cowork third-party platform guide is here: [Claude Desktop on third-party platforms](https://claude.com/docs/cowork/3p/overview).

The marketplace manifest lives at [.claude-plugin/marketplace.json](.claude-plugin/marketplace.json).

## Data contract

Every connector emits Findings that match [schemas/finding.schema.json](schemas/finding.schema.json). A Finding is one resource with one or more control evaluations.

That contract keeps connectors small: each connector only needs to collect and normalize evidence. `grc-engineer` handles framework expansion, reporting, remediation, and downstream workflows.

For the full architecture and schema example, see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
